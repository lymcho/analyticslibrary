## What This Is

This repo contains:

- `product/prompt-library.md` – the full prompt library (core product)

You can:

## How to Use

1. Open [`product/prompt-library.md`](product/prompt-library.md).
2. Find the section that matches your use case (weekly review, experiment analysis, etc.).
3. Copy a prompt, plug in your specifics (metrics, context, goals), and run it in your LLM of choice.

This library is designed for **B2B product teams** who:

- Have metrics / dashboards
- Need to get to *"so what?"* quickly
- Want to make AI do the heavy lifting on analysis and storytelling
